# GotCrewmates

This website is built using CockroachDb as the backend and uses React for the front end. The website allows users to meet new people with similar interests. The user is able to create a post with tags to allow other users to join their group. 

***This was created for the 2021 Hack the North competition.***

## To run this project:
* You need CockroachDb installed to run the backend and running on WSL
* Then run the scripts after using `chmod 777` on the scripts 
* Run `dbstartup.sh` then `buildcrewmates.sh` and if you want to use the CLI for the db, run `dbcli.sh`
* Then go to the Frontend folder and npm install and npm start
